### Problem Statement Overview:

This practical examination encompasses a range of tasks focusing on data wrangling, descriptive statistics, data analytics, text analytics, and data visualization using Python and R programming languages. Below are the details of each problem statement along with instructions:

---

### Problem Statement 1: Data Wrangling I

**Description:**
Perform data wrangling operations using Python on an open-source dataset. Tasks include importing necessary libraries, locating open-source data, loading data into pandas dataframe, checking for missing values, data preprocessing, formatting, and normalization.

### Problem Statement 2: Data Wrangling II

**Description:**
Create an "Academic performance" dataset of students and perform data cleaning operations. Tasks involve handling missing values, inconsistencies, outliers, and applying data transformations.

### Problem Statement 3: Descriptive Statistics

**Description:**
Compute summary statistics and measures of central tendency and variability on an open-source dataset. Tasks include grouping numeric variables by qualitative variables, providing summary statistics, and displaying basic statistical details of specific categories.

### Problem Statement 4: Data Analytics I

**Description:**
Build a Linear Regression Model using Python/R to predict home prices using the Boston Housing Dataset. The dataset contains various parameters related to houses in Boston, and the objective is to predict house prices based on given features.

### Problem Statement 5: Data Analytics II

**Description:**
Implement logistic regression using Python/R for classification on the Social Network Ads dataset. Compute the confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.

### Problem Statement 6: Data Analytics III

**Description:**
Implement Simple Naïve Bayes classification algorithm using Python/R on the iris dataset. Compute the confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.

### Problem Statement 7: Text Analytics

**Description:**
Perform text analytics on a sample document. Tasks involve document preprocessing methods such as tokenization, POS tagging, stop words removal, stemming, and lemmatization. Create representations of documents using Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency.

### Problem Statement 8: Data Visualization I

**Description:**
Visualize the Titanic dataset using Seaborn library. Plot a histogram to analyze the distribution of ticket prices for passengers.

### Problem Statement 9: Data Visualization II

**Description:**
Visualize the Titanic dataset using box plots to analyze the distribution of age with respect to gender and survival status. Provide observations based on the statistics.

### Problem Statement 10: Data Visualization III

**Description:**
Download and analyze the Iris flower dataset. Tasks include listing down features and their types, creating histograms and boxplots for feature distributions, and identifying outliers.

### Problem Statement 11: Scala Program with Apache Spark

**Description:**
Write a simple program in Scala using Apache Spark framework.
